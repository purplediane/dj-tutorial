# dj-tutorial

From Django Docs tutorial at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/intro/tutorial01/

2016-02-25: Apparently I started it with Django 1.8, then today upgraded to 1.9, which I'm not sure if that was a good idea, because I didn't realize I had started with 1.8, so saving as a checkpoint.
